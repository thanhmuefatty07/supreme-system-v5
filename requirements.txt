# === INSTALLATION NOTES ===
# For i3-8th gen + 4GB RAM systems:
# 1. Use: pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
# 2. System will automatically detect hardware and disable heavy components
# 3. All optional packages can be installed later if needed
#
# For systems with 8GB+ RAM:
# 1. Uncomment desired optional packages above
# 2. Install normally: pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Memory usage estimates:
# - Core only: ~1.5GB
# - Core + basic ML: ~2.5GB  
# - Core + full AI: ~4-6GB
