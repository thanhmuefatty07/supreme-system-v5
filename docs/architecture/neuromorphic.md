# Neuromorphic Engine

The neuromorphic engine uses spiking neural networks for ultra-low latency processing.

## How It Works

Traditional ML:
- Time-step based processing
- 50-100μs inference
- Continuous computation

Neuromorphic:
- Event-driven processing
- 3-5μs inference
- Zero wasted computation

## Benefits

- **10-100x lower latency**
- **Lower power consumption**
- **Natural time-series handling**
- **Adaptive learning**

## Implementation

Uses spiking neural networks that process market events like human neurons.
