### 2. Stats Section (After badges)
**Add:**
```markdown
<div align="center">

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Latency (P95)** | Sub-50ms |
| **Throughput** | 2,500+ signals/sec |
| **Test Coverage** | 25% (targeting 78%) |
| **Deployment** | <15 min |

</div>
```

### 3. What Sets Us Apart Section (Before Key Features)
**Add:**
```markdown
## 🚀 What Sets Us Apart

Supreme System V5 combines cutting-edge **neuromorphic computing** with **quantum-inspired algorithms** to achieve performance previously only possible with expensive FPGA systems:

| Metric | Supreme System V5 | Industry Standard | FPGA Systems |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Latency (P95)** | Sub-50ms | 50-100ms | <1ms |
| **Throughput** | 2.5K signals/sec | 1-3K signals/sec | 500K+ TPS |
| **Cost** | $10K-15K license | $5K-15K/year | $70K-100K+ |
| **Deployment** | <15 min (Docker) | Days-weeks | Weeks-months |

## 💡 Key Innovations

### 🧠 Neuromorphic Architecture
- **Event-Driven Processing**: React only to market events (10-100x lower power)
- **Spiking Neural Networks**: Natural time-series handling
- **Adaptive Learning**: Real-time regime change detection

### ⚛️ Quantum-Inspired Optimization
- **Portfolio Allocation**: Quantum annealing algorithms
- **Risk Management**: Multi-objective optimization
- **Pattern Recognition**: Quantum feature spaces

### ⚡ Ultra-Low Latency Pipeline
```
Market Data → Parse → Neuromorphic Inference → Signal Generation → Order Format
```

```

### 4. Update Performance Benchmarks Section
**Current (Lines 145-155):**
```markdown
## 🎯 Performance Benchmarks

| Component | Metric | Target | Achieved | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Strategy Execution** | P95 Latency | <500ms | 45ms | ✅ |
| **Data Processing** | Throughput | >1000 signals/sec | 2500 signals/sec | ✅ |
```

**Keep as is** - This is accurate and realistic.

### 5. Add Neuromorphic Section Before Architecture
**Add:**
```markdown
## 🧠 Neuromorphic Computing

Supreme System V5 uses **spiking neural networks (SNNs)** - a brain-inspired computing paradigm that processes market data like human neurons.

### How It Works

1. **Event-Driven Processing**: Unlike traditional ML models that process data at fixed intervals, SNNs react only to market events (price changes, volume spikes, etc.)

2. **Zero Wasted Computation**: No computation happens between events, resulting in 10-100x lower power consumption

3. **Natural Time-Series Handling**: SNNs are naturally suited for sequential data, making them ideal for financial time series

4. **Adaptive Learning**: The system adapts to regime changes in real-time without retraining

### Benefits

- ✅ **Lower Latency**: Event-driven processing reduces unnecessary computation
- ✅ **Better Efficiency**: Only process when market events occur
- ✅ **Natural Adaptation**: Handles non-stationary market conditions better than traditional ML
- ✅ **Cost-Effective**: Achieves competitive performance without expensive FPGA hardware

```

## Implementation Notes

1. Keep existing performance benchmarks table (accurate)
2. Add neuromorphic messaging without overpromising
3. Focus on "cost-effective alternative" positioning
4. Maintain professional tone
5. Add visual separators for readability
